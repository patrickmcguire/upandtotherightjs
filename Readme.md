Having trouble getting funding because all your customers "hate" your product and "imediately quit"?

Boss getting you down, wanting to show "progress" on "anything"?

Never fear, upandtotheright.js is here. No matter what the data set, if there's a hockeystick graph to be drawn, upandtotheright will draw it. Don't waste your time forming spurious metrics like Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income - upandtotheright will find a monotonic exponential increase in a variable and pretend that it's representative!
